# ðŸ§  Mental Health Assessment API

This project is an AI-powered mental health assessment tool built with **FastAPI** and **Sentence Transformers**. It predicts the most probable mental health condition from a user's text input and suggests relevant therapies based on a trained machine learning model.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts mental health conditions from open-ended user input
- Suggests suitable therapy methods
- Built with:
  - [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/) for semantic embeddings
  - `scikit-learn` for model training
  - `FastAPI` for serving the prediction model via an API

---

## ðŸ§© Model Details

- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional sentence vectors)
- **Classifier**: Logistic Regression
- **Training Input**: Pre-cleaned user questions related to therapy and mental health
- **Labels**: Conditions like PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, Grief, etc.
